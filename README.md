BLG-411E ~ Software Engineering Project

Recipe4Meals is an Android-platform mobile application that provides users with lists of easy-to-understand recipes and suggests several suitable dishes that the user can cook given the user\`s inventory. 

The application asks for the user\`s inventory and then it will be saved into their profile, every time the user selects a meal to cook the program reconfigures the inventory list. 

The main goal of this project is to help people cook exotic or different meals for themselves, giving them a huge sense of accomplishment. 

The other aim is for bachelors to survive on their own without becoming dependent on their mothers :)
